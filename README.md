# Felix Speagel's useful C++ libraries
A bunch of my personal C++ libraries that are (hopefuly) useful for others.

They are:
* **binary**: Managment of an arbitrary binary data
* **files**: File paths
* **macros**: Some macros that depends of the used compiler
* **math_utils**: Math objects
* **primitives**: Operations on basic C++ types
* **text**: Text modifications and queries
