# Felix Speagel's useful C++ libraries
A bunch of my personal C++ libraries that are (hopefuly) useful for others.

They are:
* [**binary**](packs/binary/README.md): Management of an arbitrary binary data,
* [**cpu**](packs/cpu/README.md): Direct instructions to CPU,
* [**files**](packs/files/README.md): File paths,
* [**geometry**](packs/geometry/README.md): 2D and 3D geometry objects,
* [**macros**](packs/macros/README.md): Some macros that depends of the used compiler,
* [**math_utils**](packs/math_utils/README.md): Math objects,
* [**misc**](packs/misc/README.md): Miscellaneous utilies that doesn't fit into other packs,
* [**primitives**](packs/primitives/README.md): Operations on basic C++ types,
* [**system**](packs/system/README.md): Things you can ask OS to do,
* [**text**](packs/text/README.md): Text modifications and queries.

## Issues
If you find any bug you are free to open an issue. I'd be glad!
