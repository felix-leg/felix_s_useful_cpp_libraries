Functions to work with strings. Divided into sub-modules, that can be included independently of each other.

* **join**: Joining an iterable object into one string, with a separator in-between.
* **convert**: Conversion between UTF-32 and UTF-8 strings. Also, on MS Windows, there are conversion functions from wide char to narrow and vice versa.
* **checks**: tests if an UTF-32 character belongs to a class of characters.
* **case**: Conversion of an UTF-32 character/string to lower/upper case.
* **split**: A reverse operation to *join*. Splits a string on a separator into a vector.
* **just**: String left/right/center justification.
